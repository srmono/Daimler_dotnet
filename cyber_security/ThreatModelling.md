# **Understanding Threat Modeling & Practical Implementation in Cybersecurity**  

**🚀 What is Threat Modeling?**  
Threat Modeling is a **proactive cybersecurity approach** to identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential security threats before they become real-world attacks. It helps developers, security teams, and architects **design secure applications and systems** by predicting and addressing vulnerabilities.  

---

## **1️⃣ Threat Modeling Process – Step-by-Step**  

### **🔹 Step 1: Define the System Scope**  
Before identifying threats, we need to understand:  
✅ **What are we protecting?** (e.g., APIs, user data, fleet tracking system)  
✅ **Who are the users?** (Admins, drivers, fleet managers)  
✅ **What data is involved?** (Sensitive GPS, vehicle logs, payments)  
✅ **Where is the data stored and transmitted?** (Cloud, databases, mobile apps)  

📌 *Example: In a Fleet Management System (FMS), GPS data must be protected from spoofing and manipulation.*  

---

### **🔹 Step 2: Identify Potential Threats**  
We analyze potential attack vectors using frameworks like **STRIDE** and **DREAD**.

#### **🔸 STRIDE Threat Model**
| **Threat**      | **Description** | **Example in Fleet Management System** |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| **S**poofing | Attacker impersonates a legitimate user | Fake GPS signal injected into system |
| **T**ampering | Data is modified or manipulated | Unauthorized changes to vehicle logs |
| **R**epudiation | Attackers deny their actions | A driver denies they exceeded speed limits |
| **I**nformation Disclosure | Sensitive data is leaked | Fleet routes leaked due to unencrypted storage |
| **D**enial of Service | Service is disrupted | DDoS attack on fleet tracking API |
| **E**levation of Privilege | Unauthorized access is gained | Driver escalates privileges to admin role |

📌 *Example: A hacker might send fake GPS coordinates to mislead logistics tracking.*  

---

### **🔹 Step 3: Prioritize Threats (Risk Assessment)**  
We use the **DREAD model** to assess risk levels:  

| **DREAD Factor**         | **Example** |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **D**amage Potential  | Can this attack cause significant loss? |
| **R**eproducibility  | How easy is it to replicate? |
| **E**xploitability  | How hard is it to exploit the vulnerability? |
| **A**ffected Users  | How many users are impacted? |
| **D**iscoverability  | Can attackers easily find the weakness? |

📌 *Example: A SQL Injection vulnerability in the fleet dashboard login is **high-risk** (easy to exploit, affects all users, can expose critical data).*  

---

### **🔹 Step 4: Implement Security Controls (Mitigation Plan)**  
For each threat, we apply **security best practices** to mitigate risks.  

#### **🔸 Countermeasures for STRIDE Threats**
| **Threat** | **Mitigation Techniques** |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Spoofing** | Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), TLS 1.3 encryption |
| **Tampering** | Digital Signatures, Data Integrity Checks (HMAC) |
| **Repudiation** | Logging & Monitoring, Immutable Audit Logs |
| **Information Disclosure** | Data Encryption (AES-256), Access Controls |
| **Denial of Service** | Rate Limiting, Web Application Firewall (WAF) |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Least Privilege Model |

📌 *Example: To prevent fake GPS data injection, implement **HMAC digital signatures** that validate GPS coordinates before processing.*  

---

## **2️⃣ Practical Implementation of Threat Modeling in a Fleet Management System (FMS)**  

Now, let’s implement **threat modeling security controls** in a **Spring Boot-based Fleet Management System**.

### **🔹 Example Use Case: Preventing SQL Injection in Authentication**
#### **🛑 Threat Identified:**
Attackers can inject malicious SQL code in login requests to bypass authentication.

#### **🔹 Step 1: Secure API Endpoint in Spring Boot**
✅ **Use Prepared Statements to Prevent SQL Injection**
```java
@Query("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.username = :username")
User findByUsername(@Param("username") String username);
```
❌ **Bad Practice (Vulnerable to SQL Injection)**
```java
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";
```

✅ **Use JPA/Hibernate for Secure Queries**
```java
@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    Optional<User> findByUsername(String username);
}
```

---

### **🔹 Example Use Case: Preventing GPS Spoofing Attacks**
#### **🛑 Threat Identified:**
Attackers inject fake GPS coordinates to manipulate fleet tracking.

#### **🔹 Step 1: Validate GPS Data with HMAC Digital Signature**
✅ **Sign GPS Data with HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)**
```java
import javax.crypto.Mac;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import java.util.Base64;

public class GPSDataValidator {
    private static final String SECRET_KEY = "secure_key";

    public static String generateHMAC(String data) throws Exception {
        Mac mac = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA256");
        mac.init(new SecretKeySpec(SECRET_KEY.getBytes(), "HmacSHA256"));
        return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(mac.doFinal(data.getBytes()));
    }

    public static boolean validateGPSData(String receivedData, String receivedHMAC) throws Exception {
        String calculatedHMAC = generateHMAC(receivedData);
        return calculatedHMAC.equals(receivedHMAC);
    }
}
```

📌 **How It Works:**  
1️⃣ When the **fleet vehicle sends GPS data**, it signs it with an **HMAC signature**.  
2️⃣ The **backend validates the signature** to ensure the data hasn’t been tampered with.

### **🔹 Example Use Case: Preventing Unauthorized Access (RBAC)**
#### **🛑 Threat Identified:**
A **driver tries to access admin functionalities**.

#### **🔹 Step 1: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
✅ **Use Spring Security to Restrict Access**
```java
@Configuration
@EnableMethodSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {
    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.csrf().disable()
            .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
                .requestMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .requestMatchers("/driver/**").hasRole("DRIVER")
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            )
            .sessionManagement(session -> session.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS));

        return http.build();
    }
}
```

✅ **Restrict API Access with Role Annotations**
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/admin")
public class AdminController {

    @PostMapping("/create-vehicle")
    @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
    public String createVehicle() {
        return "Vehicle Created!";
    }
}
```

📌 **Result:** Even if a **driver tries to call `/admin/create-vehicle`**, they will be **denied access**.

## **3️⃣ Automating Threat Modeling**
For continuous monitoring, integrate **threat modeling into DevSecOps pipelines** using:  
✅ **OWASP Threat Dragon** (Automated Threat Modeling Tool)  
✅ **Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool** (Identifies STRIDE risks in diagrams)  
✅ **Burp Suite** (Scans web apps for vulnerabilities)  

---

## **4️⃣ Summary**
✅ **Threat modeling is crucial for secure application design.**  
✅ **Use STRIDE/DREAD models to identify and prioritize threats.**  
✅ **Apply secure coding practices in Spring Boot to prevent attacks.**  
✅ **Automate threat detection using security tools.**
