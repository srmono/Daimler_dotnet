# **Cybersecurity Case Study: Fleet Management System Attack**

## **Overview of the Fleet Management System (FMS)**  
A Fleet Management System (FMS) is used to monitor and control a fleet of vehicles through GPS tracking, telematics, and real-time analytics. The system includes:  

- **Front-end:** Web-based and mobile application (React)  
- **Back-end:** Cloud-based API (Spring Boot)  
- **Database:** Stores vehicle data, driver information, and trip details  
- **IoT Devices:** GPS trackers, fuel sensors, and vehicle diagnostics  

### **Business Goals of the FMS**
✅ Improve **vehicle tracking** and driver safety  
✅ Optimize **fuel consumption** and reduce costs  
✅ Ensure **timely maintenance** and prevent breakdowns  

### **Cybersecurity Risks in Fleet Management**
🚨 Unauthorized access to **vehicle tracking data**  
🚨 Compromise of **driver personal information**  
🚨 Hacking of **IoT devices leading to fleet disruptions**  
🚨 Ransomware attacks **disrupting fleet operations**

## **Cyber Attack Scenario: GPS Spoofing & Data Breach**

### **1. Attack Initiation (Reconnaissance Phase)**  
**Threat Actor:** Cybercriminal group targeting logistics companies.  

**How the Attack Started:**  
🔍 Hackers **scanned the FMS system** for vulnerabilities using tools like **Shodan** and **Nmap**.  
🔍 They discovered **exposed APIs** (e.g., `/getVehicleLocation`) **without authentication**.  

**Cybersecurity Concept Violated:**  
❌ **Lack of Access Controls:** API endpoints were publicly accessible.  
❌ **Misconfigured Security Settings:** Weak API authentication.  

💡 **Preventive Measures:**  
✅ **Implement API Gateway & Authentication (OAuth2, JWT)**  
✅ **Limit Public Exposure of APIs** (Use private networks or VPNs)  
✅ **Rate Limiting & Web Application Firewall (WAF)** to block automated scans  

---

### **2. Exploiting Vulnerabilities (Gaining Unauthorized Access)**  
After identifying weaknesses, the hackers:  
💥 **Exploited an unpatched SQL Injection vulnerability** in the login API.  
💥 Used **stolen credentials** from a previous data breach (Credential Stuffing).  
💥 **Bypassed multi-factor authentication (MFA)** due to a misconfiguration.  

🔓 **What They Gained Access To:**  
✔️ Real-time vehicle tracking data  
✔️ Driver license and payment details  
✔️ Fleet schedules and delivery routes  

**Cybersecurity Concepts Violated:**  
❌ **Weak Input Validation:** Allowed SQL Injection.  
❌ **Failure to Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
❌ **Poor Credential Hygiene:** Allowed credential stuffing.  

💡 **Preventive Measures:**  
✅ **Use Prepared Statements & Input Validation** to prevent SQL Injection.  
✅ **Enforce Strong Password Policies & MFA** for all users.  
✅ **Use Dark Web Monitoring** to check for leaked credentials.

### **3. GPS Spoofing Attack (Man-in-the-Middle & IoT Exploitation)**  
Once inside the system, hackers:  
📡 **Manipulated GPS signals** using a **GPS spoofing tool** to create **fake locations**.  
📡 **Tampered with fleet tracking data**, making vehicles appear in the wrong locations.  
📡 **Redirected delivery trucks**, causing massive delays and financial losses.  

**Cybersecurity Concepts Violated:**  
❌ **Lack of Data Integrity Checks** on GPS signals.  
❌ **IoT Security Weaknesses** (Unsecured GPS modules).  
❌ **No End-to-End Encryption** for GPS communications.  

💡 **Preventive Measures:**  
✅ **Implement Cryptographic GPS Authentication (e.g., Secure GNSS)**.  
✅ **Use AI-Based Anomaly Detection** to flag location inconsistencies.  
✅ **Regular Firmware Updates** for IoT devices to patch vulnerabilities.  

---

### **4. Ransomware Attack (Extortion & Business Disruption)**  
After stealing data, hackers:  
🕵️ **Deployed Ransomware** across the FMS servers.  
🕵️ **Encrypted all fleet operation data** (e.g., trip history, driver records).  
🕵️ **Demanded Bitcoin ransom ($500,000) to unlock the system**.  

💡 **Preventive Measures:**  
✅ **Regular Data Backups (Immutable Storage)** to recover without paying ransom.  
✅ **Use Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)** to detect ransomware behavior.  
✅ **Zero Trust Security Model** to limit attacker movement.  

---

## **5. Incident Response & Recovery**  

After detecting the breach, the company **activated its Incident Response Plan (IRP)**:  

### **🛑 Step 1: Containment**  
🔒 Isolated affected servers to **prevent further spread**.  
🔒 Blocked malicious IPs and **disabled compromised accounts**.  

### **🛠️ Step 2: Eradication**  
⚙️ Restored fleet data **from clean backups**.  
⚙️ Patched security flaws (API authentication, GPS encryption).  

### **🚀 Step 3: Recovery & Lessons Learned**  
✅ **Implemented AI-based threat monitoring**.  
✅ **Hired a cybersecurity firm for penetration testing**.  
✅ **Trained employees on phishing & security best practices**.
