Snyk is a powerful security tool that scans various aspects of your development environment to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. 
Below is a breakdown of **what Snyk can scan** and **what it can find**.

---

## **üîç What Can Snyk Scan?**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Open-Source Dependencies** (Snyk Open Source)  
- **What it scans:**  
  - Package managers: `npm`, `pip`, `maven`, `gradle`, `composer`, etc.  
  - Dependency files: `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`, etc.  
- **What it finds:**  
  - Known vulnerabilities in dependencies (CVE-based).  
  - Insecure versions of libraries.  
  - Licensing issues (GPL, MIT, Apache, etc.).  
  - Upgrade and patch recommendations.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Proprietary Code** (Snyk Code)  
- **What it scans:**  
  - Your application‚Äôs source code (`.js`, `.java`, `.py`, `.ts`, `.go`, etc.).  
  - Supports multiple programming languages.  
- **What it finds:**  
  - Security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets).  
  - Code quality issues (insecure coding patterns).  
  - Recommendations for fixing issues.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Docker & Container Images** (Snyk Container)  
- **What it scans:**  
  - Docker images (`Dockerfile`, container registries).  
  - Base images and installed packages.  
- **What it finds:**  
  - Vulnerabilities in system packages (e.g., `libssl`, `glibc`).  
  - Insecure base images and alternative recommendations.  
  - Misconfigurations in container setup.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** (Snyk IaC)  
- **What it scans:**  
  - Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm, CloudFormation, ARM templates.  
  - Infrastructure config files (`.tf`, `.yaml`, `.json`).  
- **What it finds:**  
  - Insecure configurations (e.g., public S3 buckets, open ports, weak IAM policies).  
  - Compliance violations (CIS, NIST, ISO 27001).  
  - Best practice recommendations.

## **üîé What Security Issues Can Snyk Find?**  

‚úÖ **For Dependencies**  
- Known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).  
- Library versions with security flaws.  
- Licensing compliance risks.  

‚úÖ **For Source Code**  
- SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).  
- Hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords).  
- Insecure authentication and authorization.  
- Remote code execution risks.  

‚úÖ **For Containers**  
- Vulnerable OS packages (`Ubuntu`, `Alpine`, `Debian`).  
- Insecure default settings (`root` user usage, missing security updates).  
- Outdated base images.  

‚úÖ **For Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
- Publicly exposed cloud resources.  
- Weak security policies.  
- Non-compliant configurations (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA).

## **üöÄ How to Use Snyk?**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Snyk CLI:  
   ```sh
   npm install -g snyk
   ```  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Authenticate:  
   ```sh
   snyk auth
   ```  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Run scans:  
   ```sh
   snyk test       # For dependencies  
   snyk code test  # For source code  
   snyk container test your-image  
   snyk iac test   # For IaC security  
   ```
