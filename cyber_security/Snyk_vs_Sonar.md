## **SonarQube vs Snyk – Detailed Comparison**  

SonarQube and Snyk are **security and code quality tools**, but they focus on different aspects of **application security**.  

| Feature  | **SonarQube**  | **Snyk**  |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | Static Code Analysis (SAST) | Open Source & Dependency Security (SCA) |
| **Focus Area** | Code quality, security vulnerabilities, bugs | Vulnerability scanning for dependencies, containers, and IaC |
| **Security Scanning** | Analyzes source code for security issues (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS) | Scans **third-party libraries** for known vulnerabilities (CVE database) |
| **OWASP Compliance** | Yes, detects **OWASP Top 10 risks** | Yes, focuses on **known vulnerabilities in dependencies** |
| **CI/CD Integration** | Jenkins, GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps | GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Jenkins, Azure |
| **Programming Languages** | Java, .NET, Python, JavaScript, etc. | Supports multiple languages & **container security** |
| **Cost** | Free (Community) & Paid (Enterprise) | Free for open source, paid for advanced features |
| **Best Use Case** | Code quality & **static security scanning** | Dependency & **container security scanning** |

## **1️⃣ When to Use SonarQube?**
✅ If you need **Static Code Analysis (SAST)** to find security issues in **your source code**  
✅ If you want to improve **code quality** and **maintainability**  
✅ If you need **on-premise security scanning**  

📌 **Example:**  
SonarQube helps **detect SQL Injection** inside **your own** .NET or Java source code.  

```java
// BAD: Unsafe SQL query (SonarQube will flag this)
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";
```

## **2️⃣ When to Use Snyk?**
✅ If you need **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)** to find vulnerabilities in **third-party dependencies**  
✅ If you want **container security** (Docker, Kubernetes)  
✅ If you need **real-time CVE updates** from NVD (National Vulnerability Database)  

📌 **Example:**  
Snyk detects **vulnerabilities in open-source libraries**, like **Log4j exploits** in Java apps.  

```sh
snyk test
```
🔹 If a dependency is vulnerable (e.g., **Log4Shell CVE-2021-44228**), Snyk alerts you.

## **3️⃣ Can SonarQube and Snyk Work Together?**
Yes! ✅ **SonarQube + Snyk = Full Security Coverage**  
- **SonarQube** → Scans **your code** for **bugs & vulnerabilities** (SAST)  
- **Snyk** → Scans **your dependencies** for **known vulnerabilities** (SCA)  

📌 **Example Integration in CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**
```yaml
name: Security Scan
on: [push]
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: SonarQube Scan
        run: |
          dotnet-sonarscanner begin /k:"dotnet-app" /d:sonar.host.url="http://localhost:9000"
          dotnet build
          dotnet-sonarscanner end

      - name: Snyk Vulnerability Scan
        run: snyk test --all-projects
```

## **🛠️ Conclusion – Which One Should You Choose?**
✅ **Use SonarQube** if you need **code quality and static security analysis**  
✅ **Use Snyk** if you need **dependency security & container scanning**  
✅ **Use Both** for **full security coverage** 🚀
