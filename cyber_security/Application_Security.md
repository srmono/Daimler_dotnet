## **🔹 1. SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**
### **What is SAST?**
- Scans **source code, bytecode, or binaries** for vulnerabilities  
- Detects issues like **SQL Injection, XSS, Hardcoded Secrets**  
- Helps developers **fix security issues early**  

✅ **Pros:**  
✔ Detects vulnerabilities **before deployment**  
✔ Works **without running the application**  
✔ Supports **DevSecOps & CI/CD**  

❌ **Cons:**  
❌ Produces **false positives**  
❌ Cannot find **runtime vulnerabilities**  

**🛠️ Popular SAST Tools:**  
- **SonarQube** – Open-source static analysis  
- **Checkmarx** – Advanced security scanning  
- **Fortify SCA** – Enterprise-grade SAST  
- **Veracode SAST** – Cloud-based code security  

📌 **Best Use Case:** Secure **source code review** in **early development**  

---

## **🔹 2. DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**
### **What is DAST?**
- Scans **running applications** for security issues  
- Detects **real-time vulnerabilities** (e.g., Broken Authentication, Business Logic Flaws)  
- Uses **fuzzing & attack simulation**  

✅ **Pros:**  
✔ Detects **runtime vulnerabilities**  
✔ Identifies **business logic flaws**  
✔ Simulates **real hacker attacks**  

❌ **Cons:**  
❌ Cannot detect **source code issues**  
❌ Needs a **fully deployed app** to test  

**🛠️ Popular DAST Tools:**  
- **OWASP ZAP** – Free web application scanner  
- **Burp Suite** – Advanced web security testing  
- **Acunetix** – Automated vulnerability scanning  
- **Netsparker** – AI-powered DAST  

📌 **Best Use Case:** Security testing for **running web applications**  

---

## **🔹 3. IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing)**
### **What is IAST?**
- Runs inside the application **during testing**  
- Uses **instrumentation** to detect vulnerabilities  
- Combines **SAST (static)** & **DAST (dynamic)**  

✅ **Pros:**  
✔ Provides **real-time security insights**  
✔ **Fewer false positives** than SAST  
✔ Works well in **CI/CD pipelines**  

❌ **Cons:**  
❌ Requires **runtime agents & instrumentation**  
❌ Can **impact application performance**  

**🛠️ Popular IAST Tools:**  
- **Contrast Security** – Continuous IAST monitoring  
- **HCL AppScan IAST** – Enterprise security testing  
- **Veracode IAST** – Cloud-based IAST solution  

📌 **Best Use Case:** **Continuous security testing** in **DevSecOps**  

---

## **🔹 4. RAST (Risk-Based Application Security Testing)**
### **What is RAST?**
- Focuses security testing on **high-risk areas**  
- Uses **threat modeling & risk assessment**  
- **Optimizes security testing** by skipping low-risk code  

✅ **Pros:**  
✔ **Reduces unnecessary scanning**  
✔ **Improves efficiency** in security testing  
✔ Works well with **SAST, DAST, & IAST**  

❌ **Cons:**  
❌ Needs **risk assessment** before testing  
❌ May **miss vulnerabilities** in low-risk areas  

**🛠️ Popular RAST Tools:**  
- **Checkmarx RAST** – Prioritizes security risks  
- **Synopsys RAST** – Uses AI for risk assessment  
- **HCL AppScan RAST** – Integrates with DevSecOps pipelines  

📌 **Best Use Case:** **Efficient security testing** in **critical application areas**

## **🔹 5. Full Comparison – SAST vs DAST vs IAST vs RAST**
| Feature  | **SAST** (Static) | **DAST** (Dynamic) | **IAST** (Interactive) | **RAST** (Risk-Based) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **When It Runs** | Before execution | After deployment | During testing | Throughout SDLC |
| **Focus** | Scans **source code** | Scans **running applications** | **Combines SAST & DAST** | **Risk-based security testing** |
| **Finds Runtime Vulnerabilities?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (where risk is high) |
| **False Positives?** | ⚠️ High | ⚠️ Medium | 🔹 Low | 🔹 Very Low |
| **Best For** | Code security review | Live web app testing | Continuous security monitoring | Risk-driven security testing |

---

## **🛠️ Conclusion – Which One Should You Use?**
✅ Use **SAST** if you need **early security testing in SDLC**  
✅ Use **DAST** if you want to **test deployed applications**  
✅ Use **IAST** for **real-time security insights** in CI/CD  
✅ Use **RAST** if you need **risk-based, optimized security testing**  

📌 **Best Approach?** Combine **RAST + Traditional Security Testing** for **better efficiency**! 🚀
