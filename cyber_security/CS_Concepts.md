Cybersecurity is a broad field that involves protecting systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. Hereâ€™s an overview of key cybersecurity concepts:

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Core Cybersecurity Principles**  
1. **Confidentiality** â€“ Ensuring only authorized users can access data.  
2. **Integrity** â€“ Protecting data from unauthorized modifications.  
3. **Availability** â€“ Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Types of Cyber Threats**  
1. **Malware** â€“ Viruses, worms, ransomware, and trojans.  
2. **Phishing** â€“ Fraudulent emails or messages tricking users into revealing sensitive data.  
3. **Denial-of-Service (DoS) & DDoS Attacks** â€“ Overloading systems to make them unavailable.  
4. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks** â€“ Intercepting communication between two parties.  
5. **Zero-Day Exploits** â€“ Attacking vulnerabilities before they are patched.  
6. **Social Engineering** â€“ Manipulating people into revealing confidential information.

### ðŸ”¹ **Cybersecurity Technologies & Controls**  
1. **Firewalls** â€“ Filters incoming and outgoing network traffic.  
2. **Antivirus & Anti-malware** â€“ Detects and removes malicious software.  
3. **Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDPS)** â€“ Monitors network traffic for threats.  
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** â€“ Adds extra security layers to authentication.  
5. **Encryption** â€“ Protects data in transit and at rest.  
6. **Access Control** â€“ Restricts user access based on roles (RBAC).  
7. **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** â€“ Aggregates security logs for threat detection.

### ðŸ”¹ **Cybersecurity Domains & Frameworks**  
1. **Network Security** â€“ Protecting internal and external communications.  
2. **Application Security** â€“ Securing software from vulnerabilities.  
3. **Cloud Security** â€“ Protecting cloud-based resources (e.g., Azure Security Center).  
4. **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** â€“ Controlling user identities and permissions.  
5. **Incident Response** â€“ Preparing for and handling security breaches.  
6. **Compliance & Governance** â€“ Meeting security regulations (ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR, etc.).

### ðŸ”¹ **Best Practices for Cybersecurity**  
âœ… **Use Strong Passwords** â€“ Implement password managers & MFA.  
âœ… **Regular Patching & Updates** â€“ Keep software and OS up to date.  
âœ… **Monitor & Audit Logs** â€“ Detect suspicious activities early.  
âœ… **Least Privilege Principle** â€“ Grant users only the access they need.  
âœ… **Backup Data** â€“ Regularly create backups to prevent data loss.  
âœ… **Security Awareness Training** â€“ Educate employees to recognize threats.
