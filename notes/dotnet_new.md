When working with .NET, the `dotnet new` command provides templates for various project types tailored for different use cases. Here's a breakdown of the common project types, their purposes, and differences between approaches like **MVC**, **Controllers**, **Minimal API**, and **Fast Endpoints**.

---

### **Common .NET Project Types**

1. **`webapi`**
   - **Purpose**: Used to create RESTful APIs.
   - **Features**: Preconfigured for building APIs with controllers, JSON serialization, and routing.
   - **When to Choose**: When you need to expose services over HTTP for applications like mobile apps, web apps (as a backend), or integrations with third-party systems.
   - **Command**: 
     ```bash
     dotnet new webapi
     ```

2. **`mvc`**
   - **Purpose**: Used to create web applications with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
   - **Features**: Combines server-side HTML rendering (Views) with API capabilities (Controllers).
   - **When to Choose**: When building web applications with both server-side rendered views and API endpoints.
   - **Command**: 
     ```bash
     dotnet new mvc
     ```

3. **`minimal`**
   - **Purpose**: Create a minimal, lightweight API or application with less boilerplate code.
   - **Features**: Uses a single `Program.cs` file for routing, middleware, and logic.
   - **When to Choose**: For smaller, lightweight APIs where simplicity and speed are priorities.
   - **Command**: 
     ```bash
     dotnet new web
     ```

4. **`console`**
   - **Purpose**: Build command-line or background applications.
   - **Features**: Provides an entry point to write terminal-based applications or background jobs.
   - **When to Choose**: For utilities, CLI tools, or jobs that run without a UI.
   - **Command**: 
     ```bash
     dotnet new console
     ```

5. **`razor`**
   - **Purpose**: Build web apps with Razor Pages (focused on page-based development).
   - **Features**: Provides a simpler model for building server-side web applications.
   - **When to Choose**: For simpler, page-centric applications without the full complexity of MVC.
   - **Command**: 
     ```bash
     dotnet new razor
     ```

### **Differences Between Key Approaches**

#### **1. MVC (Model-View-Controller)**
   - **Structure**:
     - **Model**: Manages the data and business logic.
     - **View**: Renders the user interface.
     - **Controller**: Handles user input, updates models, and selects views.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for apps where server-side rendering of HTML is necessary (e.g., traditional web apps or hybrid apps with APIs).
   - **Example**:
     - Controller: Handles HTTP requests (`HomeController.cs`).
     - View: Renders HTML (`Index.cshtml`).

#### **2. API with Controllers**
   - **Structure**:
     - API Controllers (`[ApiController]` attribute) process HTTP requests and return data in JSON or XML format.
   - **Use Case**: Best for building RESTful APIs to serve data for mobile or SPA (Single Page Applications) frontends.

#### **3. Minimal API**
   - **Structure**:
     - Eliminates the need for Controllers. Routes and logic are defined directly in `Program.cs`.
   - **Use Case**: Best for lightweight and small services with a focus on simplicity and performance.
   - **Example**:
     ```csharp
     var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
     var app = builder.Build();

     app.MapGet("/api/hello", () => "Hello, World!");

     app.Run();
     ```

#### **4. Fast Endpoints**
   - **Structure**:
     - A framework built on top of Minimal APIs, offering a more structured approach with decorators and clear separation of responsibilities.
   - **Use Case**: For developers who prefer a structured framework similar to Controllers but still want the performance and simplicity of Minimal APIs.
   - **Example**:
     ```csharp
     public class HelloEndpoint : EndpointWithoutRequest
     {
         public override void Configure()
         {
             Verbs(Http.GET);
             Routes("/api/hello");
         }

         public override Task HandleAsync(CancellationToken ct)
         {
             return SendAsync("Hello, World!");
         }
     }
     ```

### **When to Choose Each Approach**

| **Approach**        | **Use Case**                                                                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Web API**          | Backend services for mobile or SPA frontends, or as part of a microservices architecture.       |
| **MVC**              | Full-stack web apps that need server-side rendering of HTML and API functionality.              |
| **Minimal API**      | Small APIs with fewer dependencies and simpler configurations.                                  |
| **Fast Endpoints**   | When you want a Minimal API with structured patterns similar to MVC Controllers.                |

### **Choosing Between SQL Server and MySQL**

| **Aspect**              | **SQL Server**                                        | **MySQL**                                  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Platform**            | Best for Windows-heavy environments.                 | Cross-platform; works well on Linux, too.  |
| **Licensing**           | Commercial (Express Edition is free with limits).    | Open-source and free to use.               |
| **Ease of Use**         | More user-friendly for beginners in .NET.            | Slightly more complex for .NET integration.|
| **Performance**         | Optimized for enterprise-level, large-scale apps.    | Highly efficient for web and smaller apps. |

In your case, since you're using **MySQL**, it's perfectly fine for your fleet management system as it is lightweight and cross-platform. SQL Server could also be used, particularly if you're already in a Microsoft ecosystem.

### Summary

- Use **webapi** for RESTful services, **mvc** for server-rendered views, and **minimal** for lightweight APIs.
- **MVC** and **Controllers** are different: MVC involves rendering views, while API Controllers focus on JSON/XML responses.
- Consider **Minimal APIs** or **Fast Endpoints** for faster development and better performance in small services.
- For databases, **MySQL** is great for lightweight and open-source solutions, while **SQL Server** is ideal for larger, enterprise-level applications.

---

With **Fast Endpoints**, you can implement applications similar to those built using **Web API**. It is well-suited for building:

1. **RESTful APIs**:  
   - For mobile apps, SPA (Single Page Applications) frontends (like Angular, React, or Vue), or as part of microservices architectures.
   - It supports standard HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

2. **Microservices**:  
   - Lightweight and modular services, perfect for microservices due to its fast performance and minimal boilerplate.

### Why Choose Fast Endpoints?

1. **Performance**:  
   Fast Endpoints builds on **Minimal APIs**, which are optimized for speed by reducing overhead.

2. **Structured Pattern**:  
   While Minimal APIs focus on simplicity, Fast Endpoints brings a structured approach, like Controllers in Web API, with the use of decorators (`[HttpGet]`, `[HttpPost]`) and clear separation of concerns.

3. **Flexibility**:  
   - You can handle **complex business logic**, use **dependency injection**, and **middleware**, just like with Web API.  
   - It's ideal for both simple and enterprise-level apps.

4. **Compatibility**:  
   The endpoints you create with Fast Endpoints can integrate seamlessly with mobile apps, SPAs, or other systems consuming RESTful APIs.

---

### When to Choose **Fast Endpoints** Over Traditional Web API?

- **For Small Services or Microservices**:  
  When you need a highly performant, lightweight API with minimal boilerplate.

- **For Developers Who Like Structure**:  
  If you find **Minimal APIs** too unstructured, Fast Endpoints offers a familiar, controller-like feel while keeping things fast.

- **For Clean Code Enthusiasts**:  
  Fast Endpoints helps avoid the clutter often associated with Minimal APIs by separating logic into classes with proper routing and decorators.

---

### Example: Fast Endpoints for Fleet Management

Here’s an example of how you might define an API endpoint in **Fast Endpoints** for fetching a truck by ID:

```csharp
using FastEndpoints;

public class GetTruckByIdEndpoint : Endpoint<GetTruckByIdRequest, TruckResponse>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Verbs(Http.GET);
        Routes("/api/trucks/{id}");
        AllowAnonymous();
    }

    public override async Task HandleAsync(GetTruckByIdRequest req, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var truck = await SomeTruckService.GetTruckByIdAsync(req.Id);
        if (truck == null)
        {
            ThrowError($"Truck with ID {req.Id} not found.");
        }
        await SendAsync(new TruckResponse { Id = truck.Id, Name = truck.Name });
    }
}
```

### Example: Request and Response Models
```csharp
public class GetTruckByIdRequest
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
}

public class TruckResponse
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```
