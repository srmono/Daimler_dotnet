To create an empty web app using the command line, you can use the .NET CLI (Command-Line Interface). Here's how you can do it step by step:

---

### **1. Open Command Prompt or Terminal**
- On Windows, open Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Windows Terminal.
- On macOS/Linux, open the terminal.

---

### **2. Create a New Web App**
Run the following commands:

1. **Navigate to the desired folder** where you want to create your app:
   ```bash
   cd path\to\your\directory
   ```

2. **Create an empty web app**:
   ```bash
   dotnet new web -n MyWebApp
   ```
   - Replace `MyWebApp` with the desired name of your app.

3. **Navigate to the newly created folder**:
   ```bash
   cd MyWebApp
   ```

---

### **3. Run the Web App**
Run the following command to start your app:
```bash
dotnet run
```

---

### **4. View the Web App**
Once the app is running, you'll see output like this:
```
Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
```
- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to see your web app.

---

### **What Does This Do?**
- The `dotnet new web` command creates an **empty web application** with minimal setup (no controllers or views).
- The structure of the project will include:
  - A `Program.cs` file to configure the app.
  - A `Startup.cs` file (for earlier versions, optional in newer .NET versions).
  - A basic configuration for hosting the web server.
