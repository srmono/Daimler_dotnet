### **Case Study: Daimler Truck Fleet Management System**

#### **Objective**
Develop a robust fleet management system using C# and .NET technologies to efficiently manage truck data, driver information, and maintenance records. The system will expose REST API endpoints for CRUD operations, handle data validation, and provide a foundation for future enhancements like user authentication and security.

---

### **Phase 1: Project Initialization**
1. **Objective**: Set up the foundation for the Fleet Management System.
2. **Tasks**:
   - Initialize a .NET project using **ASP.NET Core**.
   - Define the project structure for scalability and maintainability:
     - `Controllers` for API endpoints.
     - `Models` for data representation.
     - `Services` for business logic.
     - `Repositories` for data access using EF Core.
   - Configure **Entity Framework Core** with a database provider (e.g., SQL Server).

---

### **Phase 2: REST API Development**
1. **Objective**: Develop RESTful APIs for managing fleet data.
2. **Endpoints**:
   - **Truck Management**:
     - Add a new truck.
     - Retrieve a list of all trucks.
     - Retrieve details of a specific truck by ID.
     - Update truck information.
     - Delete a truck record.
   - **Driver Management**:
     - Add a new driver.
     - Retrieve a list of drivers.
     - Retrieve details of a driver by ID.
     - Update driver information.
     - Delete a driver record.
   - **Maintenance Management**:
     - Log a new maintenance record for a truck.
     - Retrieve maintenance records for a specific truck.
     - Update maintenance record details.
     - Delete a maintenance record.

### **Phase 3: EF Core Entity Modeling**
1. **Objective**: Design entity models and configure database relationships.
2. **Entities**:
   - **Truck**:
     - ID (Primary Key)
     - Make
     - Model
     - Year
     - License Plate
     - Status (Active, In Maintenance, Retired)
   - **Driver**:
     - ID (Primary Key)
     - Name
     - License Number
     - Contact Information
     - Assigned Truck (Foreign Key)
   - **MaintenanceRecord**:
     - ID (Primary Key)
     - Truck ID (Foreign Key)
     - Date
     - Description
     - Cost
     - Status (Pending, Completed)
3. **Relationships**:
   - One-to-Many between **Truck** and **MaintenanceRecord**.
   - One-to-One between **Truck** and **Driver** (a truck can have one assigned driver).

---

### **Phase 4: RESTful Service Implementation**
1. **Objective**: Implement CRUD operations for all entities.
2. **Tasks**:
   - Build services to handle data retrieval, updates, and business logic.
   - Validate input data using **Data Annotations** or custom validators.
   - Ensure proper status codes for API responses (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 400 Bad Request).

---

### **Phase 5: Future Enhancements**
1. **Objective**: Add authentication and security features.
2. **Tasks**:
   - Implement user login and registration using **ASP.NET Core Identity**.
   - Add JWT-based authentication for securing API endpoints.
   - Role-based access control (e.g., Admin, Fleet Manager, Maintenance Personnel).

---

### **Expected Outcome**
A scalable and secure fleet management system capable of:
- Tracking and managing truck information.
- Managing driver assignments and details.
- Logging and tracking truck maintenance records.
- Serving as the foundation for advanced fleet analytics and reporting.
