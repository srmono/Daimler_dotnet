ITruckRepository detailed breakdown of the code:

---

### **Namespace**

```csharp
namespace fleetmanagement.repositories;
```

This defines the logical grouping of this interface as part of the `fleetmanagement.repositories` namespace. It organizes repository-related code.

---

### **Interface Definition**

```csharp
public interface ITruckRepository
```

- **Interface**: A contract that specifies what methods a class implementing this interface must define.
- **Purpose**: 
  - Encapsulates database access logic for the `Truck` entity.
  - Provides an abstraction over the data access layer, promoting loose coupling between the service layer and the data access layer.

---

### **Methods in the Interface**

#### 1. **`Task<IEnumerable<Truck>> GetAllTrucksAsync();`**

- **Purpose**: Retrieves all trucks from the database.
- **Return Type**: 
  - `Task<IEnumerable<Truck>>`: An asynchronous task returning a collection of `Truck` objects.
  - `IEnumerable<Truck>`: Represents a read-only collection of trucks.
- **Async**: Ensures non-blocking operations for better scalability.

---

#### 2. **`Task<Truck?> GetTruckByIdAsync(int id);`**

- **Purpose**: Retrieves a single `Truck` by its ID.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `int id`: The unique identifier of the truck.
- **Return Type**: 
  - `Task<Truck?>`: An asynchronous task returning a `Truck` object or `null` if not found.
- **Nullable (`?`)**: Indicates the truck might not exist in the database.

---

#### 3. **`Task<Truck> AddTruckAsync(Truck truck);`**

- **Purpose**: Adds a new `Truck` to the database.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `Truck truck`: The truck entity to be added.
- **Return Type**: 
  - `Task<Truck>`: An asynchronous task returning the added `Truck` object (often with its database-generated ID populated).

---

#### 4. **`Task<Truck?> UpdateTruckAsync(Truck truck);`**

- **Purpose**: Updates an existing `Truck` in the database.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `Truck truck`: The truck entity containing updated values.
- **Return Type**: 
  - `Task<Truck?>`: An asynchronous task returning the updated `Truck` object or `null` if the truck does not exist.

---

#### 5. **`Task<bool> DeleteTruckAsync(int id);`**

- **Purpose**: Deletes a `Truck` from the database by its ID.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `int id`: The unique identifier of the truck to delete.
- **Return Type**: 
  - `Task<bool>`: An asynchronous task returning `true` if the truck was successfully deleted, or `false` if it was not found.

---

### **Summary**

This interface defines five methods:
1. **GetAllTrucksAsync**: Fetches all trucks.
2. **GetTruckByIdAsync**: Fetches a truck by its ID.
3. **AddTruckAsync**: Adds a new truck to the database.
4. **UpdateTruckAsync**: Updates an existing truck.
5. **DeleteTruckAsync**: Deletes a truck by ID.

The interface promotes:
- **Abstraction**: Hides implementation details from the rest of the application.
- **Testability**: Makes it easier to mock and test database interactions.
- **Scalability**: Adopts asynchronous patterns for improved performance in high-load scenarios.
