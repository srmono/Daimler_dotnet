### Step 1: Setting Up the .NET Application

We'll create a **C# .NET Web API** project and prepare the directory structure for the **Daimler Truck Fleet Management System**. This will allow for a clean, scalable, and maintainable architecture.  

---

### **Creating the Project**

1. **Command to Create the Project**  
   Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following:  
   ```bash
   dotnet new web -n DaimlerFleetManagement
   cd DaimlerFleetManagement
   ```

2. **Install Required NuGet Packages**  
   To prepare for database integration (MySQL), install the necessary packages:  
   ```bash
   dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
   dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql
   dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
   ```

---

### **Directory Structure**
We'll organize the project into layers for clear separation of concerns. Here's the proposed directory structure:

```
DaimlerFleetManagement/
├── Controllers/       // Handles HTTP requests and responses.
├── Services/          // Contains business logic and core operations.
├── Repositories/      // Manages database access (CRUD operations).
├── Entities/          // Holds the EF Core entity models.
├── DTOs/              // Defines Data Transfer Objects for API requests/responses.
├── Exceptions/        // Handles custom exceptions for the API.
├── Config/            // Configuration files, such as DbContext setup.
├── Program.cs         // Application entry point.
├── appsettings.json   // Configuration for database connection and other settings.
```

---

### **File/Folder Descriptions**

1. **Controllers/**  
   - Handles HTTP requests and maps them to services.  
   - Example: `TruckController.cs` will define routes like `GET /api/trucks`, `POST /api/trucks`.

2. **Services/**  
   - Contains business logic. Services call repositories and implement core application workflows.  
   - Example: `TruckService.cs` will contain methods like `AddTruck()`, `GetAllTrucks()`.

3. **Repositories/**  
   - Responsible for interacting with the database using EF Core.  
   - Example: `TruckRepository.cs` will have methods like `InsertTruck()`, `GetTruckById()`.

4. **Entities/**  
   - Defines the EF Core entity models representing database tables.  
   - Example: `Truck.cs` will define the `Truck` table structure.

5. **DTOs/**  
   - Data Transfer Objects simplify API communication by ensuring only necessary data is exposed.  
   - Example: `TruckDTO.cs` will define the request and response structure for truck operations.

6. **Exceptions/**  
   - Handles custom exceptions, providing meaningful error responses.  
   - Example: `NotFoundException.cs` for cases where requested resources don't exist.

7. **Config/**  
   - Contains configuration settings, such as database context setup.  
   - Example: `ApplicationDbContext.cs` will configure EF Core to use MySQL.

### **Next Steps**  
- **Initialization Tasks**:  
  1. Scaffold the directory structure.  
  2. Create a basic `ApplicationDbContext` and configure MySQL connection in `appsettings.json`.  

Would you like me to scaffold the initial files (e.g., DbContext and basic configurations), or shall we focus on creating one specific layer first (e.g., Controllers)?
